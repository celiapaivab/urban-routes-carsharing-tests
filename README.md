## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a QA course, focusing on **UI and functional testing** of the Urban Routes web application – a car-sharing platform. Two browsers with different screen resolutions were used to validate the behavior of the booking form and its associated features.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Test UI elements at different resolutions  
- Verify the responsiveness and layout of the booking form  
- Validate the functionality of the payment windows and "Book" button  
- Identify and report bugs using Jira

---

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools

- Manual testing  
- Browsers: Google Chrome (800x600) and Firefox (1920x1080)  
- Google Sheets (checklists and test cases)  
- Google Docs (project summary)  
- Jira (bug reporting)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Prepare the checklists and test cases in Google Sheets  
2. Execute the tests on the specified browsers and screen resolutions  
3. Mark the results as PASS or FAIL  
4. Report any bugs found using Jira  
5. Update the spreadsheets with the corresponding bug report links  
6. Document conclusions and notes in Google Docs

---

## 🧾 Results

- Detailed checklists for layout and UI elements  
- Test cases created for the “Book” button and rental process  
- Tests executed as planned in both browser environments  
- Bugs identified, documented, and organized for review

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to design manual test cases for UI and functional testing  
- Testing across different screen resolutions and browsers  
- Applying equivalence partitioning and boundary value techniques  
- How to report bugs clearly and with structure  
- Organizing test evidence in spreadsheets and shared documents

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Automate UI tests with tools like Selenium  
- Integrate manual testing into CI/CD pipelines  
- Expand coverage into areas like advanced form validation
